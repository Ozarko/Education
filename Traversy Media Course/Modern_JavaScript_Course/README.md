## Modern JavaScript From The Beginning

It was a very difficult and at the same time very interesting and intensive course. Due to the fact that Brad made it in 2018, 
it was very interesting to see the progress of the language for this short period of time. The course took more than 40 hours,
along with parsing the code and trying to implement my own code additions, a lot of useful and new information for me
and a really good investment of time and resources in my self education.
