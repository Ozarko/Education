## HTML-CSS_by_Brad_Traversy
#Project form course Modern HTML &amp; CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) by Brad Traversy.

It was amazing experience to learn HTML & CSS under Brad's teaching. In 2-3 points, I felt like Brad doesn't explain whole thing clearly. But somethimes you have to search some stuff at another places also so that you can have better understating. Other than that, I think It is the best HTML & CSS course for beginners on udemy. Worth for money and time. I am jumping into Javascript course which is created by Brad. Thank you Brad and Good luck to all.
